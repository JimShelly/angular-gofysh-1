### Introduction
In this tutorial we'll learn how to get started with Angular.  We'll discuss folder structure of an Angular application, we'll review an Angular module and discuss what it's used for.  We'll look at an Angular component and the basic pieces to a component.  We'll touch a little on Typescript, but will mostly save that for a later tutorial.
